1) What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
I am Working on the IDA (International Development Association) Statement of Credits and Grants Data. This is a part of the World Bank that helps develop poor countries. I intend to find how much credit worth each country has. And also, how many years will it take to get a country out of its debt? 

2) Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?
This analysis could help many countries, and companies to know their creditworthiness and IDA the economic situation of any country.

3) What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
Disbursed, undisbursed, and canceled Amounts for a country. the Original Principal Amounts applied. Who Borrowed the loan from the World bank from which region and country were involved in this? Which country has the highest debt? What companies and projects are involved with the highest debt to the World bank? How many credits are held by a company? 3rd parties involved, etc.

4) Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?
I got the data from “The world bank group finances – The World Bank”. The data is good and consists of 383 MB with 1.13 M Rows and 30 Columns. The features of the data are Credit Status, Project name, Region, the currency of commitment, Borrower, Country, Disbursed amount, Etc. 

5) What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?
My unit of analysis is the countries, we will be working in 137 countries, with debt towards the World bank. And The Companies involved in the debt.

6) What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?
I will be working on variables like Disbursed, undisbursed, and canceled Amounts for a country, Original, Principal, amount, Project/Company, region, country, Borrower, etc.

7) What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?
For the prediction of data like the economic situation of a country and its companies in an area, I will be using prediction models like Logistic Regression, K-Means, and Random Forest Method. Additionally, I will employ Decision Tree Classifier and Support Vector Machine to determine a company's creditworthiness and the appropriate credit limit for a given zone and project.

8) How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how do you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?
After analyzing the data I will work with ML algorithms like those mentioned in the above question. and come up with the best-suited ones based on the f1 score. 

9) What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?
Building an ML model for this project would help us understand the debt of the country and the companies to IDA, as well as the creditworthiness of IDA globally. The objective is to create a model that can evaluate and forecast a company's and countries full economic eligibility in any location. will produce the dataset's visualization for the mentioned attributes. A prediction of whether or not IDA could grant credit to a country in a certain economic condition should be the model's output.
